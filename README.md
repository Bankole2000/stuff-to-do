## What it is
An simple, well-commented, learning oriented, 2-file demo Project to practice JavaScript Programming Fundamentals. Built with:
* HTML
* Vanilla JS - ES5 & ES6
* [Materialize CSS](http://www.materializecss.com/) - Material Design CSS FrameWork
* [Google Material Icons](https://google.github.io/material-design-icons/) - Icon Font
* [LOVE](https://www.wikihow.com/Love-Programming) - Strictly for the love of coding _Mehn!_

## What it does

* Add & Delete ToDo Items
* ToDo List Badge Counter
* Search/Filter ToDo List
* Clear ToDo List
* Persist Data in Local Storage
* Quirky, random ToDo suggestions

## Learning Points
* DOM Manipulation & Traversal
* Event Handing & Delegation
* Creating & Appending Elements
* Local Storage Object Methods
* Materialize Alerts & Toasts

## Some cool stuff
Just about ___Everyone___ does a todo list when learning Front End programming), so I figured I'd spice things up - tossed in a random placeholder generating function: 
```javascript
function randomPlaceHolder(){
  const placeHolders = ['array','of','silly','placeholders'];
  const index = Math.floor((Math.random()* placeHolders.length) +1);
  todoInput.setAttribute('placeHolder',placeHolders[index]);
}
``` 
Also chose to use [Materialize CSS Toasts](https://materializecss.com/toasts.html) instead of crappy window methods (like `alert()` and `confirm()`)
```javascript
M.init(); // Initializes Materialize JS
M.toast({html:'',displayLength:1200});
```
## Features in Development
  Still working on these (its just laziness that's made me not get around to em yet though, but you can tell from the UI they're supposed to be there)
* Edit ToDo List Items
* Undo Clear & Delete Items
